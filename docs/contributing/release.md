## Version Scheme

We follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features, backward compatible
- PATCH: Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Release Steps

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project]
name = "retention"
version = "1.2.3"  # New version number
```

2. Check version against PyPI:
```bash
make check-version
```

3. Run test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

4. Build and release on TestPyPI:
```bash
make release-test
```

5. If successful, build and release to PyPI:
```bash
make release
```

    <strong>Tip:</strong> Always test releases on TestPyPI first to catch any packaging issues.
